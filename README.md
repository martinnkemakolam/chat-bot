# Chat Bot using React

## The Reply
It has a list of replies to particular question propmts but it is still not good enough. I would work more on this, The messages you send are checked if they correspond with the array propmt so you can easily change the replies and messages depending on what you want to use it for. all you have to do is add more words to the array

## Child Mode 
this searches for bad words so they would not be any rreply to them. could be toggled on or off. Also could have more words to check for if you intend to reuse it all you have to do is add more words to the array
